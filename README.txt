Contained within the github is the python notebook that was made for this project that I was the primary author of. A Collaborator was Emma Biggs Lanier, who we worked on the initital steps of the code, before I worked on the latter portions for the model prediction. To run this code, one must use either Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. From there, the Python Kernal must be installed using Python version 3.7.0. From there, the only step that needs to be taken is to run all the cells. From there the results of the code execution can be seen. These values and results are what was used to help develop the final report.
