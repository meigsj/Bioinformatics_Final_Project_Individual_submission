Contained within the github is the python notebook that was made for this project that I was the primary author of. A Collaborator was Emma Biggs Lanier, who we worked on the initital steps of the code, before I worked on the rest of the code for generating the model and making the predictions. To run this code, one must use either Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. From there, the Python Kernal must be installed using Python version 3.7.0. The use of the uploaded csv will need to be in the same directory, as that is where the gene data is being drawn from. This csv was generated from the AML Hackathon submission that we were tasked to make additions to. From there, the only step that needs to be taken is to run all the cells. From there the results of the code execution can be seen. These values and results are what was used to help develop the final report.

This code adds onto the AML Hackathon project by adding an additional model to the project. That model being Gaussion Naive Bayes with and without feature selection. The feature selection that was used was a Variance threshold of 1.5.
